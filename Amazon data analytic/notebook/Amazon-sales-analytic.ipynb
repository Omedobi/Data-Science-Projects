    "Interpretation: The discounted prices are highly variable, with most prices being lower but a few extremely high prices driving up the mean.

    "Summary\n",
    "The dataset exhibits a considerable amount of variability, particularly in prices and rating counts, with a strong tendency for positive skewness and high kurtosis in these variables, indicating the presence of outliers and extreme values. On the other hand, rating scores and discount percentages are more stable and normally distributed. These characteristics suggest that while most products are priced and rated within a certain range, there are a few exceptional products that significantly affect the overall distribution."

    "This report analyzes the categorical variables within a dataset of 1,465 product reviews. The variables include Product ID, Product Name, Category, About Product, User ID, User Name, Review ID, Review Title, Review Content, Image Link, and Product Link. Each variable is summarized by the number of unique values, the most frequent value (mode), and the frequency of that mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Product ID\n",
    "Count: 1,465\n",
    "Unique Values: 1,351\n",
    "Most Frequent Value (Top): B07JW9H4J1\n",
    "Frequency of Most Frequent Value (Freq): 3\n",
    "Interpretation: There are 1,351 unique product IDs in the dataset, with one particular product (B07JW9H4J1) appearing three times. This suggests that most products are reviewed only once or twice, with a few exceptions.\n",

    "2. Product Name\n",

    "Unique Values: 1,049\n",
    "Most Frequent Value (Top): Black)\n",
    "Frequency of Most Frequent Value (Freq): 29\n",
    "Interpretation: There are 1,049 unique product names. The name \"Black)\" appears most frequently, 29 times. This could indicate a common naming pattern or a generic description often repeated across similar products.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Category\n",
    "Count: 1,465\n",
    "Unique Values: 36\n",
    "Most Frequent Value (Top): Cables\n",
    "Frequency of Most Frequent Value (Freq): 168\n",
    "Interpretation: The dataset contains 36 different categories, with \"Cables\" being the most common, appearing in 168 records. This suggests that a significant portion of the products reviewed belong to this category.\n",

    "Frequency of Most Frequent Value (Freq): 11\n",
    "Interpretation: There are 1,045 unique descriptions in the \"About Product\" field, with \"gaming console\" being mentioned 11 times. This indicates a wide variety of product descriptions, though some terms like \"gaming console\" are repeated across several products.\n",

    "Frequency of Most Frequent Value (Freq): 83\n",

    "Most Frequent Value (Top): Good\n",
    "Frequency of Most Frequent Value (Freq): 31\n",
    "Interpretation: There are 1,020 unique pieces of review content. Similar to the review titles, the word \"Good\" is the most frequent review content, appearing 31 times, indicating a tendency towards brief and positive feedback.\n",

    "Most Frequent Value (Top): https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413sCRKobN...\n",
    "Frequency of Most Frequent Value (Freq): 3\n",

    "The dataset is characterized by a high level of uniqueness across most variables, with only a few values recurring multiple times. This suggests that while the products and reviews cover a broad range, there are some common elements such as the frequent use of the review title and content \"Good\", and the category \"Cables\". Additionally, \"Amazon Customer\" is a prevalent user identifier, reflecting anonymous or default user entries."
